                <!-- Paragraphs about me -->
                <p>My name is Nicholas Campbell, I am 23 years old, and I am currently taking a boot camp for Web
                    Development.

                <p>I have worked in retail and a retirement home for the past 4 years. Recently i decided that I don't
                    want to be stuck in these dead end jobs any longer. I looked around for different jobs that i met
                    the requirements for and found nothing interesting.</p>
                <p>While in the process of looking for something else to do with my life, my closest friends were
                    taking a bootcamp and following their dreams through it. I saw how successful and happy they were
                    with the program and decided i would go for it as well.</p>
                <p>Web Development has always been something i was interested in and I am happy to be in this course
                    trying to make a good change in my life.
